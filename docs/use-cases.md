# KCP Use Cases

Ten real-world scenarios where KCP solves concrete problems.

---

## 1. 🔍 Analytics Discovery

**Scenario:** A data analyst needs to analyze customer retention for Q1. Before writing any SQL, they want to know if someone already did this analysis.

**Without KCP:** Ask on Slack → wait hours → nobody remembers → redo the work (3-4 hours wasted).

**With KCP:**
```
GET /kcp/v1/reports?q=customer+retention+Q1&tags=analytics,churn
→ Found: 2 reports from last quarter, 1 from this quarter (different team)
→ Analyst reviews existing work, builds on top instead of starting from scratch
```

**Impact:** 3-4 hours saved per analysis × 50 analyses/month = **150-200 hours/month saved**.

---

## 2. 📊 Engineering Maturity Tracking

**Scenario:** Tech leads run automated maturity assessments across teams. Each assessment generates a detailed report with scores and recommendations.

**Without KCP:** Reports saved in personal folders → no central view → leadership asks "what's our maturity?" → manual compilation.

**With KCP:** Each assessment auto-publishes via KCP. Leadership searches by tag `maturity` to see all scores. Lineage shows what data fed each score. Historical trends visible via `parent_reports` chain.

---

## 3. 🚀 Product Discovery Reuse

**Scenario:** A product manager wants to explore a "financial wellness" feature. Before doing market research, they want to know if anyone in the organization explored something similar.

**Without KCP:** Nobody knows. PM spends 2 weeks on research that was 70% already done by another team 6 months ago.

**With KCP:**
```
GET /kcp/v1/reports?q=financial+wellness&tags=product,discovery,market-research
→ Found: 1 discovery report from Platform team (8 months ago)
→ PM reuses market sizing, competitor analysis, builds on top
```

**Impact:** 2 weeks → 3 days (reuse 70% of prior research).

---

## 4. 🔐 Compliance & Audit Trail

**Scenario:** Auditors ask: "Show us every analysis that influenced the decision to change pricing in Region X."

**Without KCP:** Scramble through emails, Slack, notebooks. Incomplete trail. 2 weeks of manual reconstruction.

**With KCP:** Query lineage chain:
```
GET /kcp/v1/reports?tags=pricing,region-x&lineage=true
→ Returns full chain: market data → competitive analysis → pricing model → executive recommendation
→ Each artifact signed by the author, timestamped, with data sources listed
```

**Impact:** 2 weeks → 2 hours. Complete, cryptographically signed audit trail.

---

## 5. 🤖 AI-to-AI Knowledge Sharing

**Scenario:** An AI monitoring agent detects an anomaly and generates a root cause analysis. Later, a different AI agent (capacity planning) needs to understand historical incidents.

**Without KCP:** AI agents operate in complete isolation. No way to share insights.

**With KCP:** Monitoring agent publishes via KCP. Capacity planning agent discovers incident reports:
```
GET /kcp/v1/reports?tags=incident,root-cause&source=monitoring-agent
→ Returns 15 incident analyses from last 3 months
→ Capacity agent uses these to improve forecasting model
```

**Impact:** First protocol enabling **AI-to-AI knowledge transfer** across agent boundaries.

---

## 6. 🏢 Cross-Team Visibility

**Scenario:** Engineering team discovers that their API gateway has a performance bottleneck. They publish analysis. Infrastructure team, unaware, is investigating the same symptoms from the infrastructure side.

**Without KCP:** Both teams spend a week independently. They discover the overlap in a weekly meeting.

**With KCP:** When Infrastructure team starts their analysis, KCP suggests:
```
"Similar report found: 'API Gateway Performance Bottleneck Analysis'
by Engineering team (2 days ago). Relevance: 0.91"
```

**Impact:** Eliminates parallel work. Enables cross-team collaboration from day one.

---

## 7. 📝 Onboarding Acceleration

**Scenario:** New hire joins the data science team. Needs to understand past analyses, methodologies, and institutional knowledge.

**Without KCP:** Read outdated wiki pages. Ask teammates. Ramp-up takes 3-4 weeks.

**With KCP:**
```
GET /kcp/v1/reports?team=data-science&from=2025-01-01&tags=methodology,analysis
→ Returns 200+ reports, searchable by topic
→ New hire can see every analysis ever published, with full context and lineage
```

**Impact:** Onboarding ramp-up from 4 weeks → 1 week.

---

## 8. 🌐 Open-Source Intelligence Sharing

**Scenario:** A security researcher publishes a vulnerability analysis. Other organizations want to access it.

**Without KCP:** Publish on a blog. No structured metadata. Hard to discover programmatically.

**With KCP:**
```json
{
  "visibility": "public",
  "tags": ["security", "vulnerability", "CVE-2026-1234"],
  "lineage": {
    "data_sources": ["nvd://CVE-2026-1234", "github://advisory/GHSA-xxx"]
  }
}
```

Any organization's KCP node can discover and retrieve via DHT. Structured, searchable, verifiable (signed by the researcher).

---

## 9. 💰 Cost Optimization

**Scenario:** Multiple teams run expensive queries on a data warehouse. Same queries are executed weekly by different people.

**Without KCP:** $50,000/month in compute costs for redundant queries.

**With KCP:** Before executing a query, the AI agent checks KCP:
```
"A report answering this exact query was published 2 days ago.
Data sources match. Reuse? [Yes/No]"
```

**Impact:** 30-50% reduction in compute costs for analytical queries.

---

## 10. 🔄 Federated Knowledge Network

**Scenario:** An industry consortium (fintech companies) wants to share anonymized benchmark data without exposing proprietary information.

**Without KCP:** Custom APIs, bilateral agreements, no standard format.

**With KCP:**
- Each company runs a KCP node
- Publishes benchmarks with `visibility: "public"` and `tags: ["fintech", "benchmark", "2026"]`
- Other companies discover via DHT
- Content is signed (verifiable source)
- Proprietary analyses remain at `visibility: "org"` or `"team"` (not federated)

**Impact:** Industry-wide knowledge sharing with zero custom integration. The protocol handles discovery, verification, and access control.
